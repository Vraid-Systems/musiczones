MusicZones
=============

This source tree contains both vanilla Java 1.5 code and Android specific source
files that make use of the standard Java code and libraries.

There are three major components to the MusicZones application:
1) back-end indexing service that scours the LAN for any supported audio containers
2) audio control systems - for controlling device audio output
3) web front-end for managing particular zone device playlist
